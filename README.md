# Smart-Traffic-System
A traffic light system for a 4-way crossroad with smart detection of red light crossing and AD screen.

This project was a required project for the Digital Systems Design (DSD) course taught by Professor Mohamed Abdelghany at the German University in Cairo (GUC).

The Smart Traffic System was implemented using the BASYS3 FPGA and coded in VHDL. The system is comprised of multiple subsystems with each using certain hardware components.

## Subsystems present:
Traffic control system using 220 Volt LED indicators.
Illegal red light crossing detection and alarm using ultra-sonic sensors and buzzers.
Electronic AD billboard using LCD Screen.

A more detailed project description of all the subsystems and how they work and part of the design process can be found in a report and a complementary video explaining the whole project in detail is uploaded Google Drive with the following link. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YDW5_ExQPoYUg2baYYNYR4MSe11RMSdW?usp=drive_link
