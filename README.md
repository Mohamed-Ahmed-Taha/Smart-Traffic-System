# Smart-Traffic-System
A traffic light system for a 4 way cross road with smart detection of red light crossing and AD screen.

This project was a required project for the Degital Systems Design (DSD) course taught by Professor Mohamed Abdelghany in the German University in Cairo (GUC).

The Smart Traffic System was implemnted using the BASYS3 FPGA and coded in VHDL. The system comprised of multiple subsytems with each using certain hardware components

## Subsystems present:
- Traffic contorl system using 120 Volt LED indicators
- Illegal red ligh crossing detection and alarm using ultra-sonic sensors and buzzer
- Electornic AD billboard using LCD Streen

A more detailed project description of all the subsystems and how they work and part of the design process can be found in a report and a complementary video explaing the whole project in detail is uploaded google drive with the following link.
